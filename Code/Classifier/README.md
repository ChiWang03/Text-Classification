The classifier contains 4 main folders
* [Classifier](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/tree/master/Code/Classifier/Classifiers)
  * Contains all the model tuning and outputs as well as the preprocessing of data
* [Data Classification](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/tree/master/Code/Classifier/Data%20Classification%20)
  * The notesbooks in this folder uses the tuned/optimized models to train an ensemble model
  * As well as use the ensemble methods to produce predictions on class labels (Classification) for the new data set (1698 record)
* [ThematicTextClassify](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/tree/master/Code/Classifier/ThematicTextClassify)
  * ThematicTextClassify is a package we wrote to help us import functions we built and the many libraries we had to import in every notebook. 
  * There are 3 .py files that were written for this package. 
    * [`EnsembleClassifiers.py`](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/blob/master/Code/Classifier/ThematicTextClassify/EnsembleClassifiers.py)
    * [`Preprocessing.py`](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/blob/master/Code/Classifier/ThematicTextClassify/Preprocessing.py)
    * [`TextClassifier.py`](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/blob/master/Code/Classifier/ThematicTextClassify/TextClassifier.py)
