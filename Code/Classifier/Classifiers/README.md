This file contains most of the training/tuning(GridSearchCV) of the models. All that is needed to change when working with these notesbook to train new data is the `pd.read_csv()` command when defining df. As long as the data set is in the same format the preprocessing and classification will be done automatically when running all the code. Note that each notebook represents a particular model so at the end we will use these tuned/trained models with its optimal paremeters to classify data in the notebooks located in the [Data Classification](https://github.com/statisticCanada/Project/tree/master/Code/Classifier/Data%20Classification%20) folder.
