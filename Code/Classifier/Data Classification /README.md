This file contains the actual classification of the models and the ensembling methods. By recording down the optimal tuning oparameters from the Classifiers notebooks, we plug in the optimal parameters to the `feature_pipe` function to classify the results of the optimal base models. In addition, if we want to use the ensemble classifiers, this may be slightly tricky. Since the ensemble classifier only takes one vectorizer, one has to look for the most common vectorizer hyperparameter used for either `tfidfVecotorizer()` or `CountVectorizer()`, then plug in the values to run the optimal ensemble model. The last part requires an understanding of Performance measures to understand which model to pick to be the optimal model to classify the new data set.
