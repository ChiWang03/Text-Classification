Food Consumed Per Capita for Canadians (2009),"In the past two decades, Canadians have shifted towards a diet which includes more fruits and vegetables, cereal products, and nuts and beans. During this time, poultry consumption has increased, while beef and pork consumption has continued to decline. Oil and fat consumption increased through the 1990s to a peak in 1998, but has since been falling steadily. Sugar available for consumption has increased over the past two years from the record low set in 2007. On a per capita basis, the Canadian diet in 2009 included more fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, coffee and fish compared with 2008. In contrast, per capita availability has declined for consumption of processed fruit and vegetables, juices, dairy products and meat products. Estimates on food availability have been adjusted to account for losses in cooking, storage and waste that occur in homes, restaurants and institutions while preparing and processing food. On a per capita basis, the Canadian diet in 2009 included more fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, coffee and fish compared with 2008. Total fresh fruit intake, including citrus, reached a record 39.3 kg per person, up slightly from 2008. After reaching a record high in 2008, processed fruit in the diet fell by 2.4% in 2009. The total fresh vegetable intake, excluding potatoes, reached a record 40.7 kg per person in 2009, slightly higher than the five-year average of 38.6 kg per person.The amount of potatoes in the diet, regardless of how they were consumed, rose by 1.4% to 27.9 kg per person in 2009. This was the first increase since 2001. Per capita red meat available for consumption continued its decline in 2009, falling by 0.7% to 23.4 kg per person per year. Intake of poultry in the diet fell by 1.2% to 13.4 kg per person, similar to levels in 2006 and 2007. Canadians consumed 16.0 kg per person of dairy products, down 3.5% from 2008. Total cereal products available for consumption recovered in 2009, increasing 0.8% over 2008, following declines in the past four years. After six years of declines, the amount of sugar and syrup in the Canadian diet has risen for two years in a row, reaching 23.8 kg per person. Total oil and fat consumption continued to decline, falling to 17.9 kg per person in 2009, down by 3.6 kg from the peak of 21.4 kg per person in 1998. Coffee consumption increased 3.6% to 90.0 litres per person in 2009. The total daily intake of calories per person fell to 2358.2 calories, down by 155.0 since the peak recorded in 2001.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/21-020-x/2009001/aftertoc-aprestdm1-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can

"Trends and correlates of frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, 2007 to 2014 (Health Report)","Fruit and vegetable consumption is recommended as part of a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables are a source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, and carotenoids. They also provide fibre, which is important for digestive health. Diets that include fruit and vegetables have been linked to a lower risk of some chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. High consumption of fruit and vegetables suggests better diet quality. In 2014, Canadians reported consuming fruit and vegetables an average of 4.7 times a day, a slight, but significant, decrease from 5.0 times a day in 2007. The decrease over time was no longer significant when fruit juice was excluded (dropping to an average of 4.1 times a day in both years). Canadians drank less juice in 2014 than in 2007, a decline that was apparent across all age, sex and household income quintiles, all regions, and all weight categories. In 2014, Canadians who reported consuming fruit and vegetables 5 or more times a day tended to be female, in younger age groups, in the highest household income quintile, and neither overweight nor obese.

"Fruit and vegetable consumption, 2016 (Health Fact Sheets)
","This is a Health fact sheet about fruit and vegetable consumption among Canadians aged 12 and older. The results shown are based on Canadian Community Health Survey questions that measured the number of times respondents reported that they consumed fruit and vegetables, rather than the actual quantity consumed. Fruit and vegetable consumption provides an important source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, which may reduce the risk of heart disease and some types of cancer. In 2016, 30.0% of Canadians aged 12 and older (roughly 8.6 million people) reported that they had consumed fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. Females were more likely than males to report consuming fruits and
vegetables five or more times per day (36.9%, 22.9%). The proportion of males aged 12 and older who reported that they had consumed fruits and vegetables five or more times per day declined between 2015 and 2016 (24.8%, 22.9%),
while the proportion for females remained stable. In 2016, fruit and vegetable consumption among females was lowest among those aged 12 to 17 (30.5%) and highest among those aged 35-49 (40.4%). Conversely, consumption of fruit and vegetable among males was higher among the 12 to 17 year olds (27.7%) compared to those aged 35 and older (Chart 1). Comparisons by province indicated that Quebec had the highest proportion of residents who reported eating fruits
and vegetables at least five times daily (38.4%). Less than 1 in 5 (18.3%) respondents in Newfoundland and Labrador reported consuming fruits and vegetables 5 times a day. In 2016, fruit and vegetable consumption habits differed by the highest level of education attained by members of the household. When the highest level of completed education was below post-secondary, 24.1% of Canadians aged 12 and older ate fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. The proportion of people who consumed five or more fruits and vegetables per day was highest where post-secondary graduation was attained by a member of the household (31.7%). Fruit and vegetable consumption also varied by household income. The percentage of Canadians aged 12 and older who consumed fruits and vegetables at least five times daily was highest in households that fell within the highest income quintile (33.0%).

In 2008, 43.7% of Canadians aged 12 or older reported that they consumed fruit and vegetables five or more times per day, up from 37.6% in 2001. Throughout that period, women were more likely than men to consume fruits and vegetables five or more times daily. In 2008, about half of women in all age groups reported that they ate fruit and vegetables five or more times daily. Among men, boys and youths aged 12 to 19 had the highest rate (47.6%) of consuming fruit and vegetables five or more times a day. Senior men consumed fruit and vegetables less frequently (40.3%) than did 12- to 19-year-olds, but more frequently than did men aged 20 to 64. In Quebec, 53.2% of residents reported eating fruit and vegetables at least five times daily - the only province in which the rate was above the national level in 2008. Alberta and British Columbia were about the same as the national figure and all other provinces and territories were lower. There was no difference between urban and rural areas in 2008 in the consumption of fruit and vegetables five or more times daily.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2010001/article/11101-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can
"Heavy drinking, 2016 (Health Fact Sheets)","This is a Health fact sheet about heavy drinking among Canadians aged 12 and older. The results shown are based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey. In 2016, 19.0% of Canadians aged 12 and older (roughly 5.8 million people) reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. The proportion aged 12 and older who reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers remained stable between 2015 and 2016. Overall, males were more likely (23.8%) to report heavy drinking than females (14.2%) in 2016.The highest proportion of heavy drinking for both sexes was among those aged 18 to 34. In this age group, 34.4% of males and 23.4% of females were heavy drinkers. Despite the fact it is illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under 18 in Canada 27.9% of Canadian youth aged 12 to 17 reported consuming an alcoholic beverage in the previous 12 months. Among those who did drink, 41.8% of them did so at least once a month. Overall 4.0% of youth were classified as heavy drinkers. The 2016 Canadian Community Health Survey included questions on alcohol use during the last week. According to Canada”s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines, 16.6% of Canadians are consuming alcohol at a level that puts their long term health at risk. Excessive alcohol consumption can have serious health and social consequences, especially when combined with other behaviours such as driving while intoxicated. For males, heavy drinking refers to having consumed five or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. For females, heavy drinking refers to having consumed four or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. According to Canada”s Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines, long term risks for alcohol consumption are liver disease and certain cancers. Males are classified at risk if they had more than 15 drinks in the week of reporting or at least one day with 4 or more drinks. Females are classified at risk if they had more than 10 drinks in the week of reporting or at least one day with 3 or more drinks. For analysis of heavy drinking with other healthy behaviours see the “Healthy Behaviours Fact Sheet”.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2017001/article/54861-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can
"Heavy drinking, 2015 (Health Fact Sheets)","This is a Health fact sheet about heavy drinking among Canadians aged 12 and older. The results shown are based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey. In 2015, 19.2% of Canadians aged 12 and older, or roughly 5.8 million people, reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. Overall, males were more likely (24.1%) to report heavy drinking than females (14.5%) in 2015. The highest proportion of heavy drinking for both sexes was among those aged 18 to 34. In this age group, 36.2% of males and 24.9% of females were heavy drinkers. Given that it is illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under 18 in Canada, the amount of heavy drinking among 12 to 17 year olds is expectedly low (4.1%). Despite the laws that prevent underage drinking, youth are still able to consume alcoholic beverages. In 2015, 27.0% of Canadian youth drank an alcoholic beverage in the previous 12 months and 40.8% of them did so at least once a month. The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was lower than the national average (19.2%) in British Columbia (17.3%). The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was higher than the national average in: Newfoundland and Labrador (25.6%) Quebec (20.2%) Saskatchewan (21.7%). The proportion of residents who reported heavy drinking was the same as the national average in the other provinces. The 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey also included questions on alcohol use during the last week. Of the 5.8 million heavy drinkers in 2015, 58.4% reported a level of alcohol consumption in the last week that put their long term health at risk. Among Canadians who were not heavy drinkers, 6.7% reported a level of consumption in the last week that poses long term risks. On average, Canadians who were classified as heavy drinkers had 9.8 drinks in the past week, compared to non-heavy drinkers who consumed 1.6 drinks.  Excessive alcohol consumption can have serious health and social consequences, especially when combined with other behaviours such as driving while intoxicated. For males, heavy drinking refers to having consumed five or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year. For females, heavy drinking refers to having consumed four or more drinks, per occasion, at least once a month during the past year.

In 2014, 17.9% of Canadians aged 12 and over (5.3 million people) reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. This was a decrease from 2013 when 18.9% were heavy drinkers. Heavy drinking was reported among 22.7% of males and 13.2% of females in 2014. For males this rate was a significant decrease from 24.5% in 2013. Compared with 2013, the rate of female heavy drinking in 2014 was about the same. Males were more likely to report heavy drinking than females for all ages, except between 12 and 19, where there was no significant difference between the sexes.

In 2013, 18.9% (5.5 million) of Canadians aged 12 and over reported alcohol consumption that classified them as heavy drinkers. Heavy drinking was reported among 24.5% of males and 13.4% of females in 2013. For males this rate was about the same as 2012 (24.3%), but a significant decrease from 26.8% in 2011. As a result of the change in definition of heavy drinking for females, 2013 estimates are not directly comparable to previous years. The increased proportion of female heavy drinkers from 10.7% in 2012 to 13.4% in 2013 is partly due to the new definition in 2013. Typically, a higher proportion of males report heavy drinking than females.  In 2013, this still holds true, even with the limit for females being lowered to four or more drinks.  Males were more likely to report heavy drinking than females for all ages, except between 12 and 17, where there was no significant difference between the sexes.

Considerable attention has been devoted to the health of Aboriginal children,1-3 but relatively little is known about their nutrition. The Health Canada publication, Eating Well with Canada’s Food Guide – First Nations, Inuit and Métis (CFG),4 offers guidelines that include foods considered traditional or country among Aboriginal people, such as bannock and wild game.

While lower percentages of Inuit children were reported to regularly consume items from these food groups, relatively high percentages consumed traditional or country foods.

"Trends and correlates of frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, 2007 to 2014 (Health Report)","Fruit and vegetable consumption is recommended as part of a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables are a source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, and carotenoids.They also provide fibre, which is important for digestive health. Diets that include fruit and vegetables have been linked to a lower risk of some chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. High consumption of fruit and vegetables suggests better diet quality.For people aged 12 or older, the 2007 Food Guide recommended 6 to 10 servings of fruit and vegetables a day.However, results of the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), which used a 24-hour recall to collect nutrition data, showed that more than 50% of Canadians aged 12 or older consumed fewer than the recommended number of servings for their age and sex group.Note 8 According to the 2014 CCHS–Annual component, the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, which is a validated indicator of diet quality,was low, with fewer than 45% reporting at least 5 times a day. Unlike discrete time-points, linear trends in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake allow for an understanding of change over time. Based on annual data from the CCHS, the present analysis describes trends in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake among Canadians aged 12 or older from 2007 to 2014. The contribution of 100% pure fruit juice to these trends, and how fruit and vegetable intake differed by socio-demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI) are also explored.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2018001/article/54901-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can

Since national-level free sugars data are not currently available for Canadians, total sugars intake was examined to understand sugars intake in the population. The objective of this analysis was to describe and compare total sugars consumption among Canadians in 2004 and 2015.Canadian children and adults consume up to 25% of their total daily energy intakes from total sugars. Compared with 2004, the percentage of total energy intakes among children from total sugarsincreased in 2015. Although an overall decrease in total sugars intakes in grams was seen when 2004 was compared with 2015, that decline can be explained in part by a combination of elements, such as changes to the food model booklet and the prevalence of misreporting between the surveys.

"Trends and correlates of frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, 2007 to 2014 (Health Report)","Fruit and vegetable consumption is recommended as part of a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables are a source of vitamins and minerals, including folate, vitamin A, vitamin C, and carotenoids.They also provide fibre, which is important for digestive health. Diets that include fruit and vegetables have been linked to a lower risk of some chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. High consumption of fruit and vegetables suggests better diet quality.For people aged 12 or older, the 2007 Food Guide recommended 6 to 10 servings of fruit and vegetables a day.However, results of the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), which used a 24-hour recall to collect nutrition data, showed that more than 50% of Canadians aged 12 or older consumed fewer than the recommended number of servings for their age and sex group.Note 8 According to the 2014 CCHS–Annual component, the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, which is a validated indicator of diet quality,was low, with fewer than 45% reporting at least 5 times a day. Unlike discrete time-points, linear trends in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake allow for an understanding of change over time. Based on annual data from the CCHS, the present analysis describes trends in the frequency of fruit and vegetable intake among Canadians aged 12 or older from 2007 to 2014. The contribution of 100% pure fruit juice to these trends, and how fruit and vegetable intake differed by socio-demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI) are also explored.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2018001/article/54901-eng.htm,Supply,Imports and Exports,Stats Can

Dietary quality in Canada,"Recommendations about what to eat, how much and what to avoid are designed to help prevent or control chronic conditions and diseases such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, anemia, diabetes and obesity.1 In Canada, such recommendations come from a number of sources, notably, Canada’s Food Guide,2 Dietary Reference Intakes1 (a joint Canada-US initiative) published by the Institute of Medicine, and organizations targeting specific diseases, such as the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Diabetes Association.Beyond specific prescriptions and proscriptions, a multidimensional measure—an index—of overall diet quality is useful.  With such a measure, it is possible to evaluate the nutritional health of populations, trace trends in eating habits, compare different groups, and assess the value of qualitative indicators of eating habits.Over the years, several diet quality indexes have been developed.3-11 These indexes assess as many as four aspects of diet quality:  adequacy, moderation, variety and balance.  Adequacy is a measure of the sufficiency of intake of nutrients and foods;  moderation, whether certain nutrients or foods are consumed in excess; variety, the diversity of food choices; and balance, the equilibrium of food intake.Because nutrition recommendations in Canada and the United States are similar, the 2005 version of the American Healthy Eating Index can be adapted to the Canadian situation.4 This article presents an adaptation of that index and briefly outlines results for Canada based on data from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey–Nutrition.  The index is also used to evaluate the Canadian Community Health Survey module on vegetable and fruit consumption as an indicator of diet quality.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2009003/article/10914/findings-resultats-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can
"Components of American 2005 Healthy Eating Index, range of scores and scoring criteria","The Healthy Eating Index was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture to measure the quality of Americans’ diets.  The original 1995 version5 was based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food Guide Pyramid.24   The Index was revised in 20054 after publication of a new version of the Dietary Guidelines.  The Healthy Eating Index assesses two aspects of diet quality:  adequacy and moderation.  The maximum possible score is 100 points.  All components are measured continuously and are reported in relation to energy consumption (Table 1).  Intake between 0 and the maximum number of points possible for each component is prorated linearly.  For the sake of comparability in this analysis, amounts were converted into the equivalent of “servings” in the most recent (2007) recommendations in Canada’s Food Guide.2   Details on the how the components are defined and the foods included in some of the less evident components are available in a technical report",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2009003/article/10914/tables/tbl1-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can
"Recommended number of servings from each food group and unsaturated fat intake per day according to Food Guide Pyramid, by age group and sex Warning View the most recent version.","The American Index uses a proportional approach to energy intake—recommended intake of various types of food is expressed per 1,000 calories of total intake.  (A diet averaging 2,150 calories a day for an adult is assumed.)  To adapt this index for Canada, recommendations are expressed as number of servings, according to age and sex, as specified in the 2007 version of Canada’s Food Guide.2  As noted above, the 1992 classification of food groups was used (see Definitions) because it was the only one available when the analysis was conducted. The Canadian adaptation is comprised of eight adequacy components (total vegetables and fruit, whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables, total grain products, whole grains, milk and alternatives, meat and alternatives, and unsaturated fats) and three moderation components (measuring saturated fats, sodium, and “other food”) (Table 2).  For the eight adequacy components, points between 0 and the potential maximum score are assigned proportionally.

"Cumulative percentage of daily energy intake from “other foods,” by population percentile, household population aged 2 or older, Canada excluding territories, 2004","The sodium component of the American Index is based on Institute of Medicine recommendations and is expressed per 1,000 calories consumed per day. The thresholds were established in relation to adequate intake (1,500 milligrams a day) and the tolerable upper intake level for an adult (2,300 milligrams a day).  Because the Canadian recommendations vary by age and sex, the Institute of Medicine recommendations by age and sex were used as the thresholds consumption in the Canadian adaptation.  Sodium consumption below adequate intake scores 10 points; consumption equal to the tolerable upper intake level  scores 8 points; consumption exceeding twice that level scores 0; and for consumption between the tolerable upper intake level  and twice the the tolerable upper intake level, scores between 0 and 8 are assigned proportionally.  As is the case for the American Index, points above the tolerable upper intake level  are assigned to prevent a flooring effect, since the usual sodium intake of the majority of the population (77% to 100%, depending on age and sex) exceeds the tolerable upper intake level.25The final moderation component of the index, worth  20  points, pertains to “discretionary calories,” a concept in the American Food Guide Pyramid, but not in Canada’s Food Guide.  The American Index assesses this component as calories derived from solid fats, alcohol and added sugar. For the Canadian adaptation, calories from “other foods” (as defined in the 1992 Canada Food Guide) represent the discretionary component. The American Index assigns 20 points for intake below 20% of calories, 0 points for intake greater than 50% of calories, and proportional points for intake between these levels, based on the 10th and 85th percentile of the distribution of daily energy intake from these sources. Application of the same reasoning to energy intake from “other foods” for the Canadian adaptation results in an interval from 5% to 40% of daily calories (Appendix Table A).",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2009003/article/10914/tables/tbla-eng.htm,Consumption,Food Consumed,Stats Can

At all ages, women’s index scores exceeded those of men. These patterns in average index scores were reflected in the percentages of various age-sex groups scoring below 50:  fewer than 3% of children aged 2 to 8, but more than 25% of 14- to 18-year-olds of both sexes and of men aged 19 to 30.

Change in total sugars consumption among Canadian children and adults (Health Report),"Sugars are a type of carbohydrate found naturally in fruit, vegetables and milk. Sugars are also added to food to improve taste or for preservation, such as in the case of jams or jellies.

Added sugars are all sugars added to foods and beverages. Free sugars refer to monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices.The latest evidence on diet and health indicates that intakes of added sugars, in particular from sugar-sweetened beverages, are associated with the risk of excess body weight and obesity in children and adults.Note 3Note 4 The consumption of sugary beverages is also associated with the risk of dental caries and poor oral health in children.Note 5 In both adults and children, the World Health Organization recommends reducing the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake.Note 2 In 2013, free sugars accounted for 62% of total sugars in Canadian prepackaged foods, although this ranged from 100% in soft drinks and fruit juices to 11% in nuts and seeds.Note 6Since national-level free sugars data are not currently available for Canadians, total sugars intakes were examined to understand sugars intakes in the population.

"Food Consumption in Canada: Part 1, 2002","Although cereals, mainly wheat, contain a lower percentage of protein than meats, they do represent an important source of protein. Not only did cereals contribute 23% of the total protein consumed by Canadians in 2001, but also the amount has been increasing, particularly since 1991. Since that year the protein provided by cereals has risen by 23%.The level of food energy consumed per Canadian, which remained relatively stable from the mid-seventies to the early 1990’s, jumped by 17% between 1991 and 2001. Rising consumption of oils followed by escalating wheat flour consumption were the major factors in the substantial increase in energy intake. Carbohydrates, the main source of energy, increased 15% between 1991 and 2001. Much of the growth can be attributed to consumers eating more pasta, specialty breads and cereal-based snacks. Total fat consumed from the food supply has climbed by 23% per person since 1991. The oils and fats category represents the biggest contributor to total fats, followed by the group of red meat, poultry and fish. A jump of 41% in the level of oils and fats is due in part to the increased use of oils throughout the 1990’s by households, fast food restaurants and other food service outlets in the preparation of salad dressings, fried foods and other commercial food products. On the other hand, the level of fat contributed by the red meat, poultry and fish group dropped to 21% in 2001 from 24% in 1991. This decrease was due principally to declining beef consumption. During the same period, consumers have turned to poultry, a naturally leaner meat, along with leaner cuts of beef and pork. Dairy products contributed to total fat 16% in 1991 compared to 14% in 2001. Lower milk consumption coupled with the shift to lower fat milk has resulted in fluid milk’s contribution to fat levels dropping dramatically. This decline has been more than offset by the large increase in fat due to increasing consumption of cheese and creams. Protein levels on the rise. The levels of protein per person provided by the Canadian food supply have been on the rise since the mid-1990’s. Overall, meat is the major source of protein with beef remaining the meat of choice for Canadians. Meat, including poultry, contributed 33% to the total in 2001, down somewhat from 1976 when it contributed 38%. Beef, as a protein source, declined sharply (39%) since 1976 while poultry has climbed 80%, partially offsetting the decline in beef. During the same period, the consumption of pork has fluctuated but remained fairly stable. Calcium levels increase. The levels of calcium continue to rise, standing in 2001 at its highest level since the late 1980’s. Milk and milk products, the largest contributor, accounts for over 70% of the calcium total. Consumers have turned increasingly to cheese and lower fat milk which has partially offset the trend to lower milk consumption. Growing consumption of fortified processed foods such as orange juice and breakfast cereal also contributed to the increase. Cholesterol levels rebounding. Total food cholesterol levels, after experiencing a steady decline since 1976 due to decreasing egg consumption, rose over the last few years. The increase in egg consumption, together with the growing popularity of cream has contributed to this growth but does not offset significantly the diminished contribution of red meat. Most other vitamins and minerals are also increasing. The levels of most vitamins and minerals available from the food supply have been increasing from 1991 to 2001. Canadians are eating more fruits and vegetables. Major factors contributing to the rise in consumption are the growing use of fresh-cut products, prepackaged salads and other processed products.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/32-229-x/32-229-x2002000-eng.pdf,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
"Use of nutritional supplements, 2015","This is a health fact sheet about the use of nutritional supplements among Canadians aged one year and older. The results shown are based on data from the Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition, 2015 and 2004. Nutritional supplements are widely available to Canadians and many people supplement their diet with nutritional products such as vitamins, minerals, fibre supplements, antacids, and fish oils. In 2015, the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition asked Canadians aged one year and older about the type and amount of nutritional supplements they consumed in the past month. Canadians living in the west were more likely than those in the east to take a nutritional supplement in 2015. Compared with the national average, for both children and adults, the prevalence of using nutritional supplements was higher in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. The highest rate of using supplements was in Alberta, both among children and teenagers at 54.1%, and among adults at 55.1%. Quebec and the Atlantic provinces had lower than national average rates of using nutritional supplements. The lowest rates were in Quebec, at 22.1% for children and teenagers, and 33.0 % for adults.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2017001/article/14831-eng.htm,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
"Bone health: Osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D","exceeds bone loss. The two processes balance out in adulthood, but with advancing age, bone mass starts to decrease. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized not only by a loss of bone mass, but also by increased bone fragility and risk of fracture. The condition primarily affects older people, particularly women, and is associated with 80% of fractures in people older than age 60. Those fractures can result in reduced quality of life, long hospital stays, institutionalization and higher mortality. The cost is high for the individuals involved and for the health care system. The prevention and treatment of osteoporosis usually entail special attention to the intake of two nutrients: calcium, which is essential for bone health, and vitamin D, which improves the absorption of calcium. Dairy products are the main dietary source of calcium, although it is also found in some fruits, vegetables and grain products. Very few foods provide concentrated Vitamin D. It is added to milk, which is the largest dietary source. The human body also creates vitamin D through sun exposure. Both calcium and vitamin D can be taken in the form of supplements. This article profiles the population aged 50 or older who reported having been diagnosed with osteoporosis. Variables associated with increased risk of diagnosis and differences between 2004 and 2009 are presented. Intake of calcium and vitamin D from food and from supplements is analyzed by the presence or absence of osteoporosis. In 2004, Canadians older than age 50 obtained an average of 771 mg of calcium a day from what they ate and drank.  Milk, cheese, bread, vegetables (except potatoes) and yogurt were the main dietary sources.  Based on the dietary reference intakes of the Institute of Medicine, about half of men aged 50 to 70 did not obtain adequate calcium from food alone;  for women aged 50 or older and for men aged 71 or older, the percentage with inadequate calcium intake from food was 80%. However, 28% of men and 48% of women aged 50 or older reported taking supplements containing calcium. Among those with osteoporosis, the percentages taking calcium supplements were higher—36% of men and 59% of women (data not shown). Total daily calcium intake from food and supplements combined averaged 969 mg for people aged 50 or older in 2004.  Depending on age group and sex, 45% to 70% had inadequate intake. The average total calcium intake of those who took supplements was 1,303 mg, 515 mg of which came from supplements.  Even so, 25% to 40% of them had inadequate total intake.  On the other hand, a substantial share of supplement users, particularly women, consumed more calcium than the tolerable upper intake level threshold of 2,000 mg. The amount of calcium obtained from food and beverages did not differ significantly between people who had and had not been diagnosed with osteoporosis. However, those with osteoporosis derived more calcium from supplements, which resulted in significantly higher total intake, compared with people who did not have osteoporosis. Milk, fish, margarine, eggs and beef are the main dietary sources of vitamin D.  In 2004, the food and beverages that Canadians aged 50 or older consumed gave them an average of 5.9 mg of vitamin D a day, well below the Institute of Medicine's EAR of 10 mg.  Based on diet alone, more than 80% of people in this age range were below the EAR. In 2004, 27% of men and 44% of women took vitamin D supplements.  For people with osteoporosis, the percentage using vitamin D supplements was 38% among men and 57% among women (data not shown). At age 50 or older, total daily vitamin D intake from diet and supplements combined averaged 10 mg.  However, 54% to 66% of people in this age range were below the EAR.  For supplement users alone, total vitamin D intake averaged 17.5 mg a day, 11.3 mg of which came from supplements; 12% to 17% of this population were below the EAR.  Fewer than 1% of people aged 50 or older had vitamin D intake above the tolerable upper intake level of 100 mg (data not shown). Men diagnosed with osteoporosis obtained less vitamin D from their diets than did men who did not have the condition;  when supplements were included, total vitamin D intake did not differ between men who did and did not have osteoporosis (Figure 3).  Among women, vitamin D intake from food and beverages was similar whether or not they had osteoporosis. However, when supplements were included, women with osteoporosis had significantly higher total vitamin D intake.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2011003/article/11515-eng.htm,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
Vitamin C status of Canadian adults: Findings from the 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey,"According to this analysis of data from the 2012/2013 CHMS, vitamin C concentrations were generally adequate among Canadian adults, even groups that tend to have lower concentrations (smokers, obese). Concentrations were related to smoking, obesity and supplement use in the adult population overall. Fruit juice consumption was significant only for groups that tend to have low concentrations. The highest concentrations were among supplement users, women, people who consumed fruit juice or citrus fruit daily, and people who were neither overweight nor obese. The last measurement of the vitamin C status of Canadians at the national level was the 1970/1972 Nutrition Canada Survey. Despite the potential for intra-laboratory and inter-assay variation,Note 8 the demographic factors associated with vitamin C status in 1970/1972 were similar to CHMS findings, with the highest median values among women aged 40 to 64, and the lowest among men aged 40 or older.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2016005/article/14612-eng.htm,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
Socio-economic status and vitamin/mineral supplement use in Canada,"This article examines factors related to Canadians' use of vitamin/mineral supplements, with emphasis on associations with household income and education. The link between diet quality and socio-economic status (SES) may extend to the use of vitamin/mineral supplements.  This article examines factors related to Canadians' use of such supplements, with emphasis on associations with household income and education. The prevalence of supplement use was significantly higher in females than in males in all age groups 14 or older.  Age, being female, high household income and education, and being food-secure were positively associated with supplement use.  Supplement use substantially increased the percentage of the population, particularly older adults, meeting the Adequate Intake level for calcium. The reported use of vitamin/mineral supplements varies by age, sex and SES.  The relatively low prevalence of use among Canadians of low SES is similar to findings from American studies.  These individuals, already at risk for inadequate intake from food, do not make up the difference with vitamin/mineral supplements. The use of supplements can increase daily intake of vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) beyond what is obtained from food alone, and thus, may confer health benefits, including chronic disease prevention",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2010004/article/11349-eng.htm,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
The effect of supplement use on vitamin C intake,"This article provides an overview of vitamin C intake among Canadians and how levels are affected by supplement use. According to results from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey–Nutrition, Canadians get an average of 132 milligrams of vitamin C a day from food.  About one adult in five has inadequate dietary intake of vitamin C.  A third of Canadians take vitamin C supplements, which add 100 milligrams to total average daily intake.  Supplement use lowers the overall percentage of adults with inadequate intake by 5 percentage points to 17%.  Smokers, people who eat fruit and vegetables infrequently, and members of households with low income and low educational attainment tend to have relatively low vitamin C intake. Just under a third (31%) of Canadians took supplements containing vitamin C in 2004. In general, the groups that had higher average dietary intake of vitamin C were also the most likely to take supplements—36% of people who ate fruit and vegetables more than six times a day did so, as did 38% of those with the highest household incomes, 34% of those who belonged to a household with at least one postsecondary graduate, 35% who were physically active, and 32% of non-smokers. Quebec differed from the other provinces in that it had the highest dietary intake. More than 20% of Canadians do not get sufficient vitamin C from their diet. Roughly a third of the population takes vitamin C in the form of supplements. While supplements virtually eliminate inadequate intake among those who take them, the impact on the population as a whole is minimal.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2010001/article/11128/findings-resultats-eng.htm,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
Vitamin D status of Canadians 2007 to 2009,"Most Canadians have vitamin D levels adequate for bone health. Women are more likely than men to have adequate vitamin D levels. In 2007-2009, almost 90% of Canadians had vitamin D levels adequate for bone health. Women were more likely than men to have adequate concentrations. About 4% of the population (5% of men and 3% of women) had levels indicating vitamin D deficiency.  In 2007 to 2009, the average level of vitamin D for Canadians aged 6 to 79 was 67.7 nmol/L.  For both sexes, levels of vitamin D followed a U-shape by age group:  highest among children and seniors, and lowest at ages 20 to 39.  Levels tended to be higher among teenage girls and women than in teenage boys and men. Almost 90% of Canadians had vitamin D levels adequate for bone health (at least 37.5 nmol/L).  Women were more likely than men to have adequate concentrations. As well, 35% of the population had levels above 75 nmol/L. The percentage with at least 75 nmol/L was highest among children aged 6 to 11 (49%) and seniors aged 60 to 79 (45%); it was lowest at ages 20 to 39 (30%). An estimated 4% of the population (5% of men and 3% of women) had levels below 27.5 nmol/L, indicating vitamin D deficiency.  The highest prevalence of deficiency—7%― was among men aged 20 to 39. Frequent milk consumption was related to vitamin D levels in people of all ages.  Those who consumed milk more than once a day averaged 75 nmol/L, compared with 63 nmol/L among those who consumed milk less than once a day.  White racial background was associated with higher levels of vitamin D.  The average difference between people whose racial background was White and people of other backgrounds was approximately 19 nmol/L.

"Nutrient intakes from food, 2015","Carbohydrates, fat and protein are the main sources of energy from food and are essential macronutrients that help our body function properly. Keeping the proportion of total energy intake for each macronutrient within a healthy range is related to a reduced risk of chronic diseases and to a diet that provides adequate amounts of essential nutrients. In 2015, the Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition asked Canadians aged one and older about what and how much they ate and drank during the previous day (the 24 hours from midnight to midnight). This food and beverage consumption information was then converted to the number of calories and nutrients consumed as defined by Health Canada’s Canadian Nutrient File. n 2015, the average percentage of daily energy intake from carbohydrates was highest among younger Canadians aged 4 to 8 (55.1%) and aged 9 to 13 (male 53.8%, female 54.7%). The rates were quite similar among male (about 46%) and female (about 48%) adult age groups 19 to 30, 31 to 50 and 51 to 70 years old. After age 70, the percentage of daily energy intake from carbohydrates increased. The lowest percentage of total energy intake from carbohydrates among men was found at the 19 to 30 age group (46.2%) and for women in the 31 to 50 age group (47.9%). For all age groups, carbohydrates represented a higher proportion of total energy intake for females than males. In 2015, young children aged 4 to 8 years obtained less than 30% of their daily energy from fat. For all other age groups, the proportion was slightly higher and ranged from 30% to 33%. The average percentage of daily energy intake from fat was highest among men (32.7%) aged 19 to 30 and women (32.9%) aged 31 to 50. There were no statistically significant differences in energy intake from fat by sex for any age group.  Young children aged 1 to 3 obtained 16.0% of their energy intake from protein. The average percentage of daily energy intake from protein increased steadily from the age group 9 to 13 years into adulthood, remained stable until 70 years old, then decreased at age 71 or older. Among men, the highest percentage of energy intake from protein was found among those aged 19 to 30 (17.9%). Among women it was highest (17.1%) among those aged 31 to 50. There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of energy intake from protein between men and women aged 31 to 70 years old. In 2015, on average males consumed more energy per day than females. For both sexes combined, average daily energy intake increased with age throughout childhood until the pre-teen years. Beginning with the 14 to 18 age group, differences between the sexes emerge. Compared with their counterparts aged 9 to 13, teenaged girls aged 14 to 18 consumed 4.3% fewer calories while teenaged boys consumed 20.6% more calories. Among males, energy intake was highest at ages 14 to 18 years (2,440 calories), stayed relatively stable for young men aged 19 to 30 years old, and then declined steadily with age. In comparison, among females, energy intake was highest at ages 9 to 13 (1,843 calories) and then slightly declined from one age group to the next. Nutrient intakes in the provinces. In all provinces, the energy intake from carbohydrates and fat by children and teenagers aged 1 to 18 was very close to the national average (carbohydrates at 53.4% and fat at 30.9%). The percentage of energy intake from protein was lower than the national level (15.6%) in Newfoundland and Labrador (14.9%), Nova Scotia (14.8%), New Brunswick (14.6%) and Manitoba (14.6%). There were no statistically significant differences from the national level in the data for children and teenagers in other provinces. Adults aged 19 years and older in Newfoundland and Labrador consumed a higher percentage of energy intake from carbohydrates (49.1%) than the national level at 47.7%. In contrast, adults in Saskatchewan had less daily energy intake from carbohydrates (46.3%) than the national average. Adults in most provinces consumed similar percentages of energy from fat with the national average at 32.2% except Nova Scotia adults with a higher rate at 33.2%. Saskatchewan adults had a higher percentage of energy intake from protein (17.8%) while adults in Prince of Edward Island (16.3%), Nova Scotia (16.4%), New Brunswick (16.4%), Quebec (16.3%) and Manitoba (16.1%) had lower rates than the national level at 17.0%. At the national level, the average daily total energy intake of children and teenagers aged 1 to 18 was 1,804 calories in 2015. Among those aged 14 to 18 years, boys (2,635 calories) in Alberta and girls (1,834 calories) in Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest energy intakes per day compared with their counterparts in other provinces. Compared to the national level of total daily energy intake (1,879 calories), adults in Quebec and Alberta consumed more calories and Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario and British Columbia consumed fewer. Among seniors aged 71 and over, men in Saskatchewan had the lowest energy intake per day at 1,606 calories, women in Nova Scotia had the lowest at 1,349 calories.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-625-x/2017001/article/14830-eng.htm,Utilization,Nutrient & non-nutrient metabolic utilization,Stats Can
Diet composition and obesity among Canadian adults,"This study examines the association between obesity and the relative percentages of fats, carbohydrates, protein and fibre in the diets of Canadians. The data are from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition. The contribution of specific nutrients to obesity has not been definitively established. The objective of this study was to determine if an association exists between obesity and the relative percentages of fats, carbohydrates, protein and fibre in the diets of Canadians. When the effect of the control variables was taken into account, total kilocalories consumed increased the odds of obesity in men, and fibre intake decreased the odds.  Among women, only total kilocalories consumed was significantly associated with increased odds of obesity. Higher consumption of kilocalories increased the odds of obesity, but the relative amounts of fats, carbohydrates and protein were generally not significant.  The sole exception was an association between higher fibre intake and lower rates of obesity among men. The prevalence of obesity has been rising in Canada in recent decades. By 2004, 23.1% of adults were obese, nearly ten percentage points higher than in 1978 (13.8%). Dietary composition—the relative proportions of calories coming from fats, carbohydrates and protein, and intake of fibre— has been suspected of playing a role in obesity. However, few studies have examined the association between excess weight and the consumption of these nutrients, and the results are inconsistent. The unexpected and sometimes contradictory findings may be due to differences in sample size, time frames, and variations in how excess weight is measured. In addition, some of the studies could not account for key factors, including total energy intake and/or physical activity levels. Others were unable to adjust for under-reporting of calories consumed—a shortcoming of many nutrition studies. Results of the present study provide further evidence that it is not what you eat, but rather, how much—the total number of calories consumed—that significantly contributes to obesity.  The results also suggest that a diet rich in fibre is associated with a reduced risk of obesity. 

This study highlights the importance of adjusting nutrition data for total energy intake and leisure-time physical activity, and especially, identifying and excluding respondents who substantially under-report the number of calories they consume.  Restricting the analysis to “plausible” respondents is an important methodological advance; without this correction, the association between calorie consumption and excess weight is lost or distorted.

These results pertain to adults, and it is unclear if they apply to individuals younger than age 18.  Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity among young people, future research could usefully examine the association between diet composition and excess weight among children and adolescents.",https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2009004/article/10933/findings-resultats-eng.htm,Health Outcome,Health Information,Stats Can

Diet and health outcomes in vulnerable populations.,"Good nutritional health is essential to physical and cognitive function, prevention or management of chronic health conditions, and prevention of disability. Poor nutritional health describes dietary intakes of inadequate amounts of energy, protein, and individual or multiple micronutrients. Homebound older adults are considered the most vulnerable for poor nutritional health; many are poor and experience persistent food insufficiency. This chapter discusses the importance of dietary intakes, especially for homebound older adults, and presents resource-related factors that influence food choice and food acquisition. These factors include limited household income, food insufficiency, and utilization of community nutrition assistance programs. Of importance is that low dietary intakes influence balance, gait speed, leg strength, and overall lower extremity physical performance (LEP).
